    <p>This section explains the inner workings of my house price prediction model.</p>
    <p>The model is based on a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest. It uses various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more to predict the price of a house. Here's how it works:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The model takes input data (e.g., house features like size, location) and processes it through multiple decision trees.</li>
        <li>Each tree makes a prediction based on different features, and the final output is an average of all the trees' predictions.</li>
        <li>This approach helps ensure accurate predictions by combining multiple perspectives from the data.</li>
    </ul>
