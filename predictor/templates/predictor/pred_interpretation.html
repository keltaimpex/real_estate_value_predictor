    <p>Understanding your house price prediction is crucial. Here are some tips to help you interpret the results:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The predicted price is an estimate based on the input features (e.g., size, location).</li>
        <li>Higher-grade houses and larger houses generally have higher prices.</li>
        <li>Location (latitude and longitude) also plays a significant role in determining house prices.</li>
        <li>If your prediction seems higher or lower than expected, consider adjusting the input features and trying again.</li>
    </ul>
