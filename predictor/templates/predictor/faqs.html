    <h4>1. How accurate is the prediction?</h4>
    <p>The accuracy depends on the quality and relevance of the input data. While this model is designed to provide a reliable estimate, I recommend cross-referencing with market trends and expert opinions.</p>

    <h4>2. Can I trust the model for all house types?</h4>
    <p>The model works best with standard residential properties. Unique properties (e.g., very large estates, highly customized homes) might not be as accurately predicted.</p>

    <h4>3. Why does the model need information about the neighborhood?</h4>
    <p>Neighborhood factors (like location, proximity to amenities, etc.) heavily influence house prices. My model uses these to ensure accurate predictions.</p>

    <h4>4. How can I improve the accuracy of my prediction?</h4>
    <p>Try to provide accurate and detailed information about the house's features, including square footage, number of rooms, and age of the property.</p>
