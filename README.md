           Setup Instructions
    Prerequisites
Python 3.x

        1. Clone the Repository  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real_estate_value_predictor.git
cd real_estate_value_predictor

       2. Set Up Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)  
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

       3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

        4. Database Setup
Apply migrations to set up the database schema:
python manage.py migrate

      5. Running the App Locally
python manage.py runserver
Now you can visit the app in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

       6. Model File
Ensure the rf_model.pkl is located in the correct directory for the app to function. This file is too large to be stored in GitHub directly, so it should be manually added after the project is set up.

                 Deployment
You can deploy this app to a platform like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean. Refer to platform-specific documentation to deploy your Django app.
